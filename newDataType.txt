Abstract 
Online labor marketplaces facilitate the efficient matching of employers and workers 
across geographical boundaries. The exponential gro wth of this nascent online 
phenomenon holds important social and economic impl ications. Despite this importance, 
limited effort has been devoted to understand wheth er potential hiring biases exist in 
online labor platforms and how they affect hiring o utcomes. Using a novel proprietary 
dataset from a leading online labor platform, we in vestigate the impact of gender-based 
stereotypes on hiring outcomes. After accounting fo r endogeneity via a matched sample 
approach and quasi-experimental technique, we find evidence of a positive hiring bias 
towards female workers at the aggregate level. Sub- category analyses show that 
women are preferred in female-dominated occupations , while men are preferred in 
male-dominated occupations. Interestingly, women al so gain an advantage in gender-
neutral jobs. We find that the observed hiring bias  diminishes as employers gain more 
hiring experience on the platform. Managerial and p ractical implications are discussed.

2 Thirty Fifth International Conference on Informatio n Systems, Auckland 2014 Introduction 
Online labor marketplaces have grown rapidly in rec ent years. The industry has experienced a great 
increase in both the number of participants and tra nsaction volume. Over the last four years, workers on 
Elance and oDesk have earned close to $2 billion th rough over 8 million jobs posted on these online 
platforms. 1 On oDesk alone, the number of employers billing on  the site has increased by over 800% 
between 2009 and 2013, accounting for almost a 900%  gain in quarterly wage bill (Agrawal et al. 2013).  
Not only do these online platforms serve as an inte rmediary for the buyers and providers of labor, the y 
also host a myriad of jobs ranging from software an d web development to administrative support and 
multimedia design, which in turn, attracts and reta ins a large pool of global workers. It is projected  that 
online labor marketplaces will grow to a $5 billion  industry by 2018. 2 Given the enormous scale of the 
online labor market, hiring decisions made by onlin e employers have significant social and economic 
consequences, as these actions implicate the income s of millions of workers worldwide. In particular, it is 
imperative to understand whether online workers are  being treated fairly in terms of job opportunities  
awarded and how discriminatory biases, if any, affe ct the hiring decisions made by online employers. 
Job discrimination pertains to the phenomenon where  groups of workers are denied access, or have 
limited access to jobs. Workers can be discriminate d based on innate attributes such as gender, race, 
disability or age that are unrelated to worker prod uctivity (Arrow 1973). Discriminatory hiring is an issue 
of concern not only because it results in the ineff icient allocation of resources, it also contributes  to 
inequitable distribution of wealth and income among  the population. As such, regulations and legislati ons 
such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964  (US) and the Sex Discrimination Act of 1975  (UK) are erected to 
prevent market failures that arise from discriminat ory labor practices. While governmental interventio ns 
are in place to protect against unfair treatment of  workers in traditional labor markets, these laws l apse in 
their coverage for online platforms due to the cros sOnational nature of working relationships forged i n 
these marketplaces. Greater awareness and better un derstanding of the hiring practices in online labor  
markets is a necessary first step for deriving effe ctive policy interventions to address the inadequac ies of 
existing antiOdiscriminatory laws. 
While extant studies on online labor markets have f ocused on the reputational signals (Lin and Goes 20 12; 
Yoganarasimhan 2013), geographical differences (Agr awal et al. 2012; Hong and Pavlou 2012), and 
bidding strategies (Hong et al. 2013; Snir and Hitt  2003) of workers, we attempt to examine a more 
fundamental aspect of worker characteristics in thi s nascent labor marketplace. In particular, we aim to 
assess whether worker’s gender can lead to hiring b iases, and how gender stereotypes can affect the hi ring 
decisions in online labor markets. Gender stereotyp es create a predisposition towards negativity that 
precludes the recognition of a worker’s skill and a bility. The importance of gender stereotypes on hir ingO
related outcomes has led academics from diverse fie lds including economics, psychology, management, 
and sociology to examine its antecedents and conseq uences (e.g., Darity and Mason 1998; Gorman 2005; 
Ibarra 1992; Olian et al. 1988; Swim et al., 1989).  In addition, the study of gender biases in online labor 
platforms is particularly crucial for understanding  whether the presence of such stereotypes would 
eliminate the very benefits that online labor marke ts bring to workers who are disadvantaged due to 
genderOrelated discrimination in offline settings. 3  
In the present study, we focus on examining the imp act of workers’ gender on hiring outcomes in one of  
the largest online labor marketplaces. The unusuall y rich dataset from the online platform allows us t o 
observe all attributes that employers see in the jo b applicants’ profiles. Thus, the threat of omitted

3 In some countries, female candidates may not be se lected for a job on the basis that they are pregnan t or are likely to 
be pregnant in the near future. In other cases, a f emale worker may have trouble reOentering the corpor ate world after 
periods of maternity leave. For instances of these cases, see http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/877000.shtml  and

Thirty Fifth International Conference on Informatio n Systems, Auckland 2014 3 variable bias is greatly reduced in our estimation as our models are able to account for all observabl e 
worker characteristics that hirers take into consid eration when making hiring decisions. Moreover, we 
have multiple observations across job categories an d employers, allowing us to account for heterogeneo us 
hiring preferences in our estimations. Using highly  detailed observations of worker and job characteri stics, 
we first assess the effects of gender identity on h iring outcomes using a matched sample approach. To 
further account for potential endogeneity issues, w e deploy a quasiOexperiment design to validate the 
relationship between workers’ gender and their like lihood of being hired. Contrary to expectations in 
traditional labor studies, results from various mod el specifications indicate that online hiring bias tends to 
act in favor of female workers in general. Several additional tests are used to assess the robustness of the 
results. We further investigate the moderating effe ct of platformOspecific experience on hiring bias.  
Our study aims to make a few contributions to the l iterature. First, this paper contributes broadly to  the 
literature related to the social and economic impli cations of online platforms (e.g., Brynjolfsson et al. 
2003; Chan and Ghose 2014; Zhang and Liu 2012) by s hedding light on whether hiring biases prevail in 
online labor markets. The awareness of stereotyping  behavior in online hiring decisions allows policy 
makers and platform owners to gain macroOlevel insi ghts towards the need for specialized policies and 
guidelines to regulate these online markets.  
Second, by demonstrating the nature of gender stere otypes in online markets, our study illustrates the  
important point of whether outcomes in online conte xts are consistent with that from the traditional 
marketplaces (e.g., Brynjolfsson and Smith 2000; Ch ellappa et al. 2011). Not only does this finding ha ve 
crucial implications towards policy design, it also  serves to benefit managers and employers at the mi croO
level by providing managerial inputs that inform th em of the peculiar biases that can potentially affe ct 
their hiring decisions in online environments. Like wise, workers from the disadvantaged group may gain  
from the study findings by taking steps to rectify the undue biases that are imposed on them in online  
settings.  
Third, we attempt to provide deeper insights into t his phenomenon by unraveling the specific condition s 
under which gender stereotypes will have a stronger  impact on hiring outcomes. The moderating effect o f 
platformOspecific experience provides inroads for a cademics in understanding the potential mechanism 
that underlie the decision making process in uncert ain environments (Lipshitz and Strauss 1997; Simon 
1979). Furthermore, by pinpointing the conditions u nder which hiring biases are most acute, various 
stakeholders of the online labor marketplaces can m ake appropriate adjustments to mollify the potentia l 
market inefficiencies.  
Finally, we make a potential methodological contrib ution to the labor discrimination literature by 
introducing a quasiOexperiment approach in the onli ne context to identify the effect of stereotypes on  
hiring outcomes. Past work has largely relied on au dit and correspondence studies to examine the exten t 
of hiring bias (Riach and Rich 2002). While these m ethods may perform well in identifying the causal 
impact of stereotypes on hiring outcomes, they are generally expensive, time consuming, and tedious to  
execute. Consequently, implementation of these fiel d experiments is restricted to few specific jobs 
openings at one time, affecting the external validi ty of such approaches. Using quasiOexperimental 
approaches to study hiring biases on large number o f online hiring outcomes is not only less tedious t o 
execute, it also provides the opportunity to examin e the effect of stereotyping across multiple job 
categories and openings. Furthermore, the quasiOexp erimental approach along with the full set of worke r 
covariates observed from the online platform produc es estimation results that are similar or better th an 
that achieved in field experiments.   
The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. In  the following section, we provide a review of the 
literatures relevant to online labor markets, occup ational discrimination and gender stereotypes. Next , we 
describe the context of our study and our data, whi le formulating econometric models to assess the imp act 
of gender identity on hiring outcomes in the subseq uent section. Following that, we present the main 
results of our model estimations as well as further  evaluations of the role of gender stereotyping on hiring 
likelihood. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of our results and their implications for various 
stakeholders. 
Literature Review 
Online labor marketplaces differ from the tradition al counterpart in several important aspects. First,  the 
global reach of online platforms provides a larger set of choices than is generally available in the o ffline Economics and Value of IS 
 
4 Thirty Fifth International Conference on Informatio n Systems, Auckland 2014 markets (Brynjolfsson et al. 2003), thereby allowin g employers to access a larger pool of workers than  
before. The flexibility and freedom afforded by Int ernet telecommunications can also induce individual s 
who are previously out of the labor market to parti cipate through this online marketplace (Dettling 20 13). 
As such, the increased access and diversity of choi ces may contribute positively towards lower search costs 
and better matching efficiency in online markets (A utor 2001; Overby and Jap 2009). Second, online 
communications facilitated by the platform eliminat e the need for employers and workers to meet faceOt oO
face during the job recruitment and fulfillment pha ses. While online communications may have ushered 
in greater convenience and accessibility, it can al so exacerbate information asymmetry issues that 
underlie the job hiring process (Akerlof 1979; Hort on 2010). Third, jobs posted on online labor market s 
are largely short term contracts. The transient wor king relationships formed in online labor markets a re 
neither governed by career advancement incentives n or employee benefits requirements, which 
consequently leads to incentive misalignment issues  that can intensify principalOagent problems. 
Therefore, the trustworthiness of the involved part ies are more important in online markets than in 
offline ones (Bakos 1997; Pavlou and Gefen 2004). 
Given the critical differences that online platform s possess, it is unclear whether hiring outcomes in  
online labor markets would follow the expectations from traditional markets. On the one hand, the 
enhanced matching efficiency of online platforms co upled with the comprehensive listing of standardize d 
worker information (e.g., online ratings, number of  past jobs, and wage rate) can reduce the amount of  
uncertainty inherent in the hiring process (cf. Bak os 1997; Brynjolfsson and Smith 2000), by allowing 
employers to locate appropriate candidates and prof iciently comparing them on common measures of 
ability and credentials. This in turn eliminates th e need for employers to rely on heuristics that are  based 
on workers’ physical traits when making hiring deci sions. On the other hand, the lack of nonOverbal cu es 
in online communications may exacerbate information  asymmetry issues in the hiring process (Akerlof 
1979; Dennis et al. 2008; Horton 2010). Given that subtle personal information such as work attitudes 
and professionalism are less readily available in t he online environment, the reliance on gender 
stereotypes in making hiring decisions may be more prevalent online (Terborg 1977). The theoretical 
tension therein produces an ambiguous understanding  of the uncertainty faced by employers as a result of 
the affordances in the online labor platform.   
Past studies on online labor markets have indirectl y demonstrated this theoretical tension. Using 
Elance.com data, Banker and Hwang (2008) show that measures of past worker performance, such as 
online ratings and cumulative earnings, hold positi ve relationships with the worker’s probability of b eing 
hired. Hong and Pavlou (2012) also find that platfo rm measures such as feedback rating, number of 
completed projects, gold member status, and project  completion rates can positively influence employer ’s 
hiring decisions on Freelancer.com. These results d emonstrate that the informational affordances of 
platform can help reduce uncertainty in online labo r markets. Not only do employers utilize the 
informational features in the online marketplaces, they exhibit strong reactions to these affordances.  For 
instance, by randomly hiring and providing feedback  to oDesk workers, Pallais (2014) demonstrates that  
even minimal amount of positive information can hel p to increase a worker’s future earnings drasticall y. 
Stanton and Thomas (2012) find that inexperienced w orkers affiliated with an agency have substantially  
higher jobOfinding probabilities at the beginning o f their careers on oDesk. The heavy reliance on the se 
informational features suggests that employers are faced with high levels of uncertainty in the hiring  
process due to acute information asymmetry issues t hat are inherent in the online context.  
The ambiguous effect on hiring uncertainty in onlin e settings produces an unclear understanding on 
whether gender stereotypes are involved in hiring d ecisions. In the case where hiring biases are indee d 
present, a followOup question is how gender stereot ypes would affect hiring outcomes in online 
environment. While there is a long history of liter ature delineating the impact of discriminatory hiri ng in 
traditional labor contexts, the existing theory and  evidence on the effect of gender stereotyping in o nline 
environments are largely nonOexistent. We discuss t he various streams of literatures pertinent to our 
study context next. 
Occupational Discrimination 
Scholars have identified two types of occupational discrimination at work. In statistical discriminati on, 
the difference in the treatment of men and women ar ise from the expectation that these two groups have  
different levels of productivity (Phelps 1972 ; Arrow 1973). In contrast, tasteObased discriminati on stems Hiring Biases in Online Labor Markets 
Thirty Fifth International Conference on Informatio n Systems, Auckland 2014 5 from an animus towards one group (Becker 1957). Tho ugh it is hard to distinguish between the two types  
of discrimination, several studies have consistentl y demonstrated that gender discrimination holds a 
significant impact on hiring outcomes.  
Under the audit study method, researchers use match ed pairs of individuals of different gender to 
masquerade as job hunters to solicit for hiring res ponses. Using this method, Neumark et al. (1996) an d 
Goldin and Rouse (1997) found that women faced hiri ng discrimination at highOprice restaurants and 
symphony orchestras, respectively. In correspondenc e studies, pairs of fake resumes with similar 
characteristics but with different names signaling disparate gender are sent to job evaluators. Result s 
from some correspondence studies revealed that fema le candidates are universally discriminated against  
(e.g., Riach and Rich 1987), while others found sup port for occupational segregation, a situation wher e 
hirers prefer hiring male workers for masculine job s and female workers for feminine jobs (e.g., Booth  
and Leigh 2010; Glick et al. 1988; Jawahar and Matt sson 2005). Under a separate study technique of 
tracing applicants’ referral network, Fernandez and Sosa (2005) find that female applican ts are in fact 
favored over males for an entryOlevel customer serv ice job at a large bank.  The lack of consensus across 
study findings in traditional labor markets suggest s that the process of occupational discrimination i s a 
complicated one that has varying effects on hiring decisions, and is temporally and contextually 
dependent.  
Gender Differences 
It is well recognized that males differ from female s in various aspects. Women are generally perceived  as 
warm, gentle and kind, whereas men are viewed as to ugh and aggressive (Huddy and Terkildsen 1993). 
Studies have also shown that women are being seen a s more trustworthy, helpful, reciprocal and altruis tic 
than men (Andreoni and Petrie 2008; Buchan et al. 2 008; Eckel and Grossman 1998; Orbell et al. 1994). 
These perceptual gender differences are found to ma nifest as differential treatment of males and femal es 
in situations that involve trusting strangers. Evid ence of such has been reported in the online peerOt oOpeer 
credit markets, among others. For instance, Ravina (2008) found that female borrowers were rated as 
more trustworthy and were more likely to get loans than male borrowers. Similarly, Pope and Sydnor 
(2009) revealed that female borrowers have a higher  likelihood of being funded and received lower 
interest rates on loans compared to their male coun terparts. As such, perceptions of gender difference s 
can play important roles in affecting hiring outcom es, particularly in contexts where trust is a cruci al 
enabling factor in relations where there is uncerta inty and fear of opportunism (Gefen et al. 2003; Ma yer 
et al. 1995). 
From a social role perspective, men are expected to  demonstrate independence from others through 
successful individual performances, while women are  seen to be more communally oriented which 
manifests through behaviors of interpersonal cooper ation, relationship formation and maintenance 
(Tannen 1990). At the same time, men are attracted to competition, while women are inclined to avoid 
competitive situations (Gneezy et al. 2003; Niederl e and Vesterlund 2007). Taken jointly, these gender  
traits explain why women avoid negotiation situatio ns, and are more likely to accept lower offers than  
men (Babcock and Laschever 2003; Eckel and Grossman  2001; Kray et al. 2002). This gender difference 
is pertinent to employment situations as aggressive  negotiation styles are found to affect the likelih ood 
with which agreements are reached (Hamner 1974). 
Data 
To address our research questions related to online  hiring biases, we use a novel proprietary dataset from 
a large online labor market which consists of highl y detailed job posting information between August 
2012 and December 2013. 4 We limit our study sample to jobs that are filled with one hired applicant, so 
that definite hiring outcomes can be observed. We f ocus our analyses on hiring outcomes for jobs that are 
paid hourly as opposed to those paid on the basis o f fixed prices to abstract from the differences in project 
sizes and durations. Job applications from India, B angladesh, Philippines, Pakistan, and United States  
represent over 85% of all applications on the platf orm. We further restrict our dataset to job applica tions 
from these top five countries so that results would  be free from the influence of outlier effects. Bas ed on 
                                                             
4 Based on a nonOdisclosure agreement, we are not all owed to disclose the identity of the online labor p latform. Economics and Value of IS 
 
6 Thirty Fifth International Conference on Informatio n Systems, Auckland 2014 the screening steps, our resultant dataset contains  a total of 194,596 job postings. 
For each job application, we have information on wh ether the contractor has been previously hired by t he 
current employer who posted the job, the job catego ry, whether the employer invited the worker to send  a 
job application, and the hourly wage proposed by th e worker. On top of the jobOspecific information, w e 
also have a rich set of worker attributes including  first and last name, worker type (i.e., independen t or 
agency contractor), English proficiency, country of  residence, education attainment, employment histor y, 
overall feedback score, number of portfolio items, number of certifications obtained, number of tests 
passed, number of jobs completed, and whether a pro file photo is posted. Among these worker attributes , 
some of the worker’s credentials are selfOreported,  while others are verified by the platform. The key  
outcome variable in this study is whether a worker is hired. 
Gender Inference 
In preventing discriminatory behaviors and privacy breaches, the platform does not collect demographic  
information such as age, gender, race, and religion  from its workers. Despite this precautionary step,  
employers are likely able to infer the gender ident ity of workers from either their names and/or profi le 
photos. We make a similar inference of the worker’s  gender through the application of machineOlearning  
approaches on the names and photos found on workers ’ profiles. 
The platform requires all workers to use real and v erifiable first names on their profiles. Several st udies 
demonstrated the possibility of inferring gender id entity from first names (e.g., Gallagher and Chen 2 008). 
In particular, Tang et al. (2011) constructed a com prehensive list of first names with annotated gende r 
probabilities based on data from public Facebook pr ofile pages of 1.67 million users. Using the nameO
gender probability estimates from Tang et al. (2011 ), we match the worker’s name in our sample to that  in 
the list, and inferred the worker’s gender using a cutoff confidence value of 95%. In cases where the 
probability is less than 95%, we label the gender o f the worker as unknown.  
Furthermore, a large proportion of workers (85.88%)  in our dataset posted a photo on their profile pag e. 
Compared to names, photos convey more direct and sa lient information about one’s gender. Advances in 
the computer vision and machine learning have produ ced mature techniques for the automatic extraction 
of facial features such as pupilOtoOnose vertical d istance, chin radii, eyebrow thickness, and hair fo r gender 
prediction (e.g., Gutta et al. 1998; Yang et al. 20 06; Gao and Ai 2009). We developed a programming 
script that makes use of a facial recognition packa ge to perform gender classification on profile phot os of 
workers in our dataset. 5 A minimum accuracy of 95% confidence was imposed o n the facial recognition 
exercise.

Using the two approaches described above, we are ab le to infer the gender information of 168,500 
contractors. To check the overall accuracy level of  our labels, we crossOvalidate the inferred genders  for 
workers under the two approaches. We find that the agreement rate is 95.20% for female workers and 
97.10% for male workers. Observations with mismatch ed genders from the two approaches are omitted 
from our analysis. Given the high agreement in the predicted gender across independent sources of 
information (i.e., name and photo), we believe our crossOvalidation approach has yielded a dataset wit h 
highly accurate gender labels. A summary of all var iables in our dataset and its respective descriptiv e 
statistics is presented in Table 1. 
Empirical Methodology 
To examine the question on whether gender identity affects hiring outcome, we employ a conditional 
logistic specification (McFadden 1973). The conditi onal logit model is often used to understand how 
choices are made among a set of products with varyi ng characteristics such that the consumer maximizes  
utility from his/her choice (e.g., Guadagni and Lit tle 1983). In our setting of online hiring, the emp loyer 
can be seen as a consumer who makes a choice among the set of applicants (products). The systematic 
component of utility includes the set of observable  attributes listed on the worker’s profile ( /g1876/g3036/g3037 ) at the time 
of application, the gender of the applicant ( /g1859/g3037), and a unique dummy variable for each job posting  for 
capturing unobserved jobOspecific effects ( /g2011/g3036). The utility that the employer can derive from hi ring worker 
j is given by: 
/g1873/g3036/g3037 = /g1876/g3036/g3037 β	+/g1859/g3037α	+γ/g3036+ε/g3036/g3037 	,						∀/g1861	ϵ	/g46701,2,…,/g1840 /g4671,∀/g1862	ϵ	/g46701,2,…,/g1836 /g3036/g4671.    Economics and Value of IS

where /g1851/g3036/g3037  is an indicator for whether applicant /g1862 is hired. The coefficients β (a vector of utility weights 
reflecting the importance of nonOgender attributes,  /g1876/g3037), α (the utility weight reflecting the importance of 
worker’s gender, /g1859/g3037) are to be estimated. The estimation of the gender  identity parameter ( /g2009) is our 
primary concern. Utility ( /g1873/g3036/g3037 ) is an unobserved latent variable that is revealed  through an employer’s 
choice of worker /g1862 for a particular job posting /g1861. A repeated cross sectional dataset at the job lev el is used 
for this analysis, in which applications for each j ob form multiple observations for each unit of anal ysis. It 
should be noted that job related characteristics ar e not used in this specification as the jobOlevel f ixed 
effects are in place. NonOgender attributes ( /g1876/g3037) include the worker characteristics listed in Tabl e 1. 
Though a complete set of observable worker attribut es along with unobserved heterogeneity job effects 
are accounted for in the conditional logit model, e ndogeneity issues may still exist in the estimation  of 
gender effects on hiring outcome. As observed from past studies on labor discrimination, a potential 
source of endogeneity may arise from selection effe cts, which involve systematic differences in both 
observed and unobserved abilities of male and femal e applicants for each job (Pager et al. 2009; Riach  
and Rich 2002). Ideally in our analyses, we would l ike each job candidate to be contrasted with a 
comparable individual of the opposite gender such t hat hiring outcomes are not driven by differences i n 
workers’ ability but by their gender identity. Whil e it is impossible to find perfect counterfactuals in field 
settings or to control for all ability differences using observable traits, we are able to mitigate th is source 
of endogeneity by employing a matched sampling appr oach. A propensity score matching strategy is used 
to find the closest match for every female applican t in the dataset to derive a sample of job applican ts with 
comparable counterparts of the opposite gender. The  matching exercise also helps to remove job posting s 
that do not contain comparable applicants from both  genders, thereby reducing estimation biases 
generated by postings that have exceptional strong (weak) candidates that have very high (low) 
probability of being hired. 
To further rule out concerns on endogeneity, we emp loy a quasiOexperiment technique to address 
potential estimation biases that arise from unobser ved differences in workers’ ability levels. Having access 
to rich observations of a large number of worker pr ofiles over time, we are able to isolate a pool of workers 
whose gender identities are unclear to hirers. We a chieve that by identifying workers whose names are 
uncommon and are not informative of gender identity . As a default, we define uncommon names to be 
those that appeared ten times or less in the annota ted name list that was used to identify worker’s 
gender. 6 Among these genderOanonymous workers, we further i dentify a subOpopulation of workers who 
did not have a profile photo at the beginning of th e study period but have added a photo to their prof ile 
before the end of the study period. We restrict the  timeframe of consideration to 1.5 years so that an y 
changes in workers’ abilities and qualifications wi ll be minimal.  
Based on the selection criteria, the resultant data set comprises of a panel of workers whose gender 
identities are ambiguous initially but are clarifie d later via the information conveyed in their poste d 
profile photos. By comparing the hiring outcomes of  each worker before and after the posting of photos , 
we are able to identify the impact of gender on hir ing likelihood. This identification strategy addres ses 
estimation issues from differences in workers’ abil ities by having each worker to be his/her own 
counterfactual when his/her gender identity is unkn own to hirers. We estimate the model of the followi ng

photo ( /g2009/g2871) provides us with the effect of the hiring bias wi thin the quasiOexperiment set up. We note that 
the gender main effect ( /g2009/g2869) under this specification represents differential ability and quality across 
workers of different sex.  
In the specifications above, we examine the overall  hiring probability across all job categories to 
understand whether gender discrimination exists at the aggregate level. To further understand the natu re 
of gender stereotype that is prevalent in the onlin e setting, we perform subsample analyses by repeati ng 
our estimations on observations for three specific job categories: femaleOdominated occupations, maleO
dominated occupations and genderOneutral occupation s. We rely on two sources of information to classif y 
jobs into each of categories. First, we tabulate th e proportion of male to female applicants for each job 
category and determine if they fall above or below the average maleOfemale ratio of workers on the 
platform. Second, we rely on the occupation gender composition information provided by the Bureau of 
Labor Statistics (BLS; see http://www.bls.gov ) to identify genderOdominated jobs. Under these tw o 
categorizations, we find that “Administrative Suppo rt” jobs consistently fall under femaleOdominated 
occupations; “Software Development” is categorized as maleOdominated occupations; “Design & 
Multimedia” belongs to genderOneutral occupations. By examining the effect of gender on hiring outcome s 
across these job categories, we can assess whether the directionality of the hiring bias is dependent on 
occupational stereotypes. 
Results 
Main results 
We present the regression results from Equation 1 i n Table 2. In column 1, we estimate a basic model 
where no matching is used. Columns 2 to 5 show the regression estimates derived under matched samples.  
More specifically in columns 2 and 4, the observati ons are made up of workers who are matched within 
the same job category, while those in columns 3 and  5 are obtained by matching workers within each job  
posting. Within each job category and posting, we r equire exact matching on employer invitation, 
previously hired, and agency contractor, and perfor m propensity score matching on other attributes. Th e 
caliper size used is 0.01 in columns 2 and 3, and a  caliper size of 0.001 is used in columns 4 and 5. All 
matching is performed without replacement, under co mmon support. A balance check indicated that the 
standardized bias after matching is below 5%, sugge sting that the matching process has resulted in a 
balanced sample of male and female workers (Caliend o et al. 2008). 
In column 1, we see that female variable holds a po sitive coefficient that is significant at the 1% le vel, 
suggesting that female workers enjoy a higher likel ihood of getting hired compared to their male 
counterparts. The gender estimates under the matche d sample are also positive and significant at the 1 % 
level, thereby affirming the relationship observed in the unmatched sample. That means that after 
accounting for differences in worker ability via on eOtoOone matching, a hiring bias in favor of female  
candidates is still present. In particular, the str ictest matching strategy (column 5) suggests that t he odds 
of a female applicant being hired are 21.7% higher than that of a male applicant.  
Estimates of the control variables are informative of how various jobOrelated and workerOspecific 
attributes affect the likelihood of being hired. Jo b specific characteristics such as whether the empl oyer 
invited the candidate for the focal job, whether wo rker sent his/her CV and whether the worker was Economics and Value of IS 
 
10 Thirty Fifth International Conference on Informatio n Systems, Auckland 2014 previously hired by the employer have positive infl uence on hiring likelihood. As expected, the hourly  rate 
charged by the worker correlates negatively with th e likelihood of hiring. We further find that selfO
declared characteristics by the worker generally do  not affect the likelihood of hiring, with the exce ption 
of number of offline jobs performed and English pro ficiency. In contrast, platformOverified informatio n of 
the workers holds significant relationships with hi ring likelihood. This result is similar to those fo und in 
studies of online reputation, illustrating that onl ine signals have an impact on market outcomes 
(Dellarocas 2003; Pallais 2012). 
We ran further robustness checks which involve the use of alternative dependent variables that indicat e 
employer’s interest and willingness to hire prospec tive job applicants. The dataset allows us to know 
whether the employer has invited workers to apply f or the posted job and whether the employer has 
initiated an interview with prospective candidates.  Regression results based on job invitations and 
candidate interviews as dependent variables provide  qualitatively similar conclusions in that female 
workers are more likely to receive job invitations and job interviews than male workers.

Results from quasi-experiment setup 
Next, we report the results that are derived under the quasiOexperimental strategy. Under this setup, the 
hiring bias effect is observed when employers make their hiring decisions based on the gender identiti es 
inferred from the posted photos of workers. The eff ect of hiring bias is captured by the Female × Has 
Photo  variable in Table 3. In column 1, we observe that the interaction term is positive and significant at  
the 1% level, suggesting that hiring bias is presen t and its effect works in favor of female applicant s. 
Specifically, when no photo is available, the odds of a female applicant being hired are 36.6% lower t han 
that of a male applicant. This negative main effect  from the Female  variable suggests that male applicants 
may have stronger abilities and jobOfit compared to  female candidates. Next, the positive coefficient on 
the Photo  variable indicates that all job applicants benefit  from the posting of photos. However, the 
magnitude of the benefit differs between the two ge nders in that the odds of being hired increases by 113.8% 
for female applicants but only by 22.3% for male ap plicants. Furthermore, the odds of females with 
photos being hired are 10.8% higher compared to mal es with photos. Therefore, the revelation of gender  
gives a disproportionate advantage to female worker s.

To evaluate the robustness of this result, we repea ted the analysis in column 1 using more stringent 
criteria. In columns 2 and 3, we tighten the criter ia of uncommon names by selecting workers whose 
names appear five times or less, and did not appear  at all in our annotated list, respectively. Result s in 
columns 2 and 3 show that the interaction term cont inues to hold a positive and significant coefficien t, 
signifying that the previous result is robust to st ricter definitions of name commonality. Next, we as sess 
the robustness of the result with respect to outlie rs. Within this panel of workers, there are workers  who Economics and Value of IS 
 
12 Thirty Fifth International Conference on Informatio n Systems, Auckland 2014 posted their photos late (early) resulting in few ( many) instances of job application with exposed gen der 
identity. To account for these outliers, we remove applicants who have few job applications with or 
without posted photos. Columns 4 and 5 report the r esults for which the minimum number of 
applications with or without photos is 3 and 5, res pectively. The regression results derived under the se 
samples remain qualitatively similar to that in col umn 1, suggesting that the findings in this quasiO
experiment setup is robust.  
Nature of gender bias in hiring 
To examine the nature of gender bias in our setting , we investigate the hiring outcomes for various jo b 
categories on the platform, split by feminine, masc uline and genderOneutral occupations. In Table 4, w e 
report the regression results of the samples matche d by job category and job posting, using various 
matching criteria.7 The results are consistent across different model specifications for genderOdominated 
occupations, so we only discuss the effect sizes us ing the first specification. From column 1, we see that 
the odds of females being hired are 41.6% higher fo r administrative support positions (i.e., feminine 
occupation). In addition to that, column 3 shows th at females are 19.1% less likely to get hired in so ftware 
development jobs (masculine occupation), in terms o f odds ratio.8 This set of results provides evidence in 
support of occupational segregation in online hirin g decisions, that is, employers prefer hiring femal e 
workers for femaleOdominated occupations and male w orkers for maleOdominated occupations.   
Interestingly, we note that female workers are more  likely to be hired in jobs posted under the design  and 
multimedia category (genderOneutral occupation). Mo re specifically from column 2, we note that the odd s 
of female workers being hired is 16.4% higher for j obs posted under the design and multimedia category  
(genderOneutral occupation). While the coefficients  in columns 2, 5, 8, and 11 are not always signific ant, 
the direction of the coefficient is highly consiste nt in showing a positive bias towards female worker s for 
genderOneutral jobs.  
Moderating effect of employer experience 
It is plausible that the hiring bias may change ove r time, particularly so when employers gain experie nce 
in hiring workers on the online platform. To assess  this possibility, we run the conditional logit 
regressions on different samples of employers, spli t by their hiring experience on the platform. In 
particular, we split the sample of employers into u pper and lower quartiles of the number of workers 
hired.  
In Table 5, we see that the gender coefficients fro m the “low experience” employers are positive and 
significant, while the gender coefficients for “hig h experience” employers are nonOsignificant. This s et of 
results indicates that hiring bias mainly exists in  new employers who have few hiring experiences on t he 
labor marketplace, and the bias diminishes as emplo yers make more hires on the platform. We also note 
that this effect is consistent across different str ingency in matching criteria, suggesting that the o bserved 
trend is rather robust.

Discussion and Implications 
This study is among the first empirical effort to i nvestigate the presence of gender bias in the conte xt of 
online hiring. We use a rich set of controls, along  with a matched sample approach to account for 
endogeneity issues that arise from individual diffe rences across job applicants. We further address 
estimation biases through the use of a quasiOexperi ment strategy which sets each applicant up as his/h er 
own counterfactual when his/her gender identity is unknown to hirers. Our results provide evidence for  
the presence of a hiring bias that is in favor of f emale applicants. In addition, our analyses suggest  that 
employers are influenced by the perception of sexOt yped jobs, in that they are more likely to hire wom en Economics and Value of IS 
 
14 Thirty Fifth International Conference on Informatio n Systems, Auckland 2014 for feminine jobs and men for masculine jobs. Femal es are also likely to enjoy a greater hiring likeli hood 
in genderOneutral jobs. Lastly, our results demonst rate that the hiring bias dissipates with increased  
hiring experience on the platform. 
This study provides several important insights for academics, policy makers, online platform owners, a nd 
hiring managers. First, the discovery of a gender b ias in the online hiring decisions is counterintuit ive to 
our understanding as anonymity is a major defining characteristic of online environments. In online 
contexts where personal identities can be easily co ncealed and manipulated, we would expect biases bas ed 
on personal characteristics to be minimal or nonOex istent. Yet, in the effort to promote authenticity and 
trust in the online labor marketplace, user provide d information such as real names and photos have th e 
unintended consequence of facilitating opportunitie s for hiring biases to take place. The presence of a 
gender bias implies the need to implement policies and regulations in the online labor market to curb 
such unwarranted behaviors. While platform owners s hould still collect real names for identity 
authentication, they could consider using pseudonym s or screen names for worker profiles. In addition,  
platform owners should encourage workers to use ava tars and screen names that are not informative of 
workers’ demographic characteristics, so that hirin g biases based on stereotypes can be minimized.  
Second, the directionality of the hiring bias demon strates the important point that online mediums can  
bring about drastic differences to phenomenon that occur in offline contexts. Though gender occupation al 
segregation exists in both offline and online envir onments, the hiring biases in online labor markets tend 
to manifest as a preference for female workers in g eneral. This trend operates in an opposite fashion to 
observations in traditional labor markets where hir ing biases work against female workers. Such an 
outcome may be surprising to labor economists but i s not unexpected to IS academics, as a multitude of  
extant IS studies has consistently show that trust is a crucial factor in enabling relationships and 
transactions in online markets (Gefen et al. 2003; Pavlou et al. 2007). As hirers face risks and uncer tainty 
in the online environment, they are prone to rely o n cues signaling that the applicant is not a bad wo rker 
(e.g., workers who intentionally delays the duratio n of the project to get larger earnings under the h ourly 
payment, negotiating project deliverables with empl oyers after the start of the contract, and asking f or 
payment bonuses prior to starting a project). To th is effect, females gain an advantage from the gener al 
perception that they are more honest, trustworthy, cooperative, and less inclined to negotiate working  
terms with their employers.  
With the aim to provide evidence that the lack of t rust is a potential underlying reason leading to hi ring 
bias, we examine the moderating effect of employer experience on the relationship between gender 
stereotype and hiring outcomes. Under this test, we  found that the hiring bias favoring women dissipat es 
as employers make more hires on the online platform . We theorize that repeated usage of the online 
marketplace allows the employer to learn and build up confidence in the efficacy of the institutional 
measures for addressing agency problems (e.g., time  tracker which monitors worker’s actual working 
hours, online procedures to dispute the work qualit y and charges incurred). After gaining trust in the  
online labor platform, employers’ reliance on inher ent biases to make hiring decisions is likely reduc ed. 
As such, the hiring bias in online labor market pre sents an interesting situation for policy makers an d 
platform owners, as it is largely motivated by a tr ust inertia inherent in all inexperienced employers . The 
traditional strategies used for reducing discrimina tory hiring may not be fully effective in this onli ne 
context. Potential remedies for such bias in online  environments involve platform owners providing 
assurance to new employers through indicators and m easures of the worker innate qualities such as 
worker’s timeliness, integrity, attitudes and profe ssionalism. 
Finally, results in the quasiOexperiment design sug gest that females are hired even when male applican ts 
are more effective for the posted job. The hiring b ias induced by an unfounded preference for female 
produces market inefficiencies for the online labor  market. The gender bias obfuscates and overwhelms 
the consideration of applicants’ ability and jobOfi t, which results in the rejection of wellOsuited ca ndidates 
over lessOqualified applicants. This finding is par ticularly relevant to hiring managers as it serves to 
inform them of the inherent biases that they may ha ve when making hiring decisions in online 
marketplaces. As such, practitioners hiring workers  in online marketplaces should be cautious about 
making hiring decisions based on undue influence fr om stereotypes. Admittedly, this hiring bias might 
arise unintentionally and unwillingly, which is why  platform owners bear the ultimate weight of provid ing 
relevant site infrastructure to reduce information asymmetry present in the online context.  
Our study is not without limitations, some of which  may serve as research agendas for future studies. First, Hiring Biases in Online Labor Markets 
Thirty Fifth International Conference on Informatio n Systems, Auckland 2014 15  our study findings are confined to the observations  from one online labor marketplace. Given that 
different online labor markets may differ and have peculiar characteristics (i.e., types of job offere d, 
worker composition, quality assurance mechanisms), it may be plausible that the results on hiring bias  in 
this study may not generalize to other online platf orms. However, we are less worried about this as ou r 
study site represents one of the largest labor mark etplaces in the Internet which hosts a significant 
number of active projects and workers. Regardless, future efforts to crossOvalidate our findings will 
strengthen the external validity of our study.  
Second, by focusing our study on hiring bias from g ender stereotypes, our study is unable to provide 
insights related to biases that arise from other ty pes of discriminative hiring (e.g., racial, age). F uture 
studies may want to delve into the equally crucial issue of how other stereotyping perceptions of race  and 
age may affect hiring outcomes. In particular, the combination of multiple stereotyping traits (i.e., male 
workers from India vs. female workers in India, Chi nese male workers from China vs. Chinese male 
workers in Indonesia) can prove to hold interesting  and meaningful relationships with hiring outcomes.   
Third, a related point to the previous point is tha t this study examines stereotyping behavior from th e 
perspective of hiring decisions. Labor discriminato ry practices may also exhibit through wage differen tials 
across disparate groups of individuals (e.g., Alton ji and Pierret 2001). It is possible that females m ay 
receive an advantage in terms of higher hiring like lihood but suffer a penalty in their wages received  in the 
online market. Insights into the multiOaspects of l abor discriminatory practices will help decision ma kers 
arrive at holistic interventions and policies to ta ckle stereotyping behaviors in its entirety.  
Finally, we reasoned that the overarching preferenc e in hiring female workers lies on the perception t hat 
women are generally seen as more trustworthy and co operative than men. While this trend has received 
much theoretical support from extant studies on per ceptual differences in genders, future research may  
contribute to this literature by providing empirica l validation of this relationship in the online con text via 
surveys, interviews and anecdotal evidence. 
As online labor marketplaces continues to grow in i ts size and reach, a greater proportion of the worl d’s 
employers and workers would be transacting through this online intermediary. Though the benefits of 
reduced search costs and efficient matching are lar gely welcomed by parties from both the demand and 
supply end, the expansion of online labor markets a lso ushers in similar social and economic issues th at 
are observed in traditional marketplaces. While suc h issues are carefully monitored and regulated in 
offline markets, these practices have not been thor oughly and widely applied to online labor markets, as 
the rise of these intermediaries represents a relat ively nascent phenomenon that has not been fully 
understood. Our study fills this gap by shedding li ght on the prevalence and nature of hiring bias in online 
labor markets. The implications for future research  and policy are important, as the understanding of 
stereotyping behaviors in online contexts is a crit ical first step towards the effective design of gui delines 
and policies to improve market efficiency and to en force labor equality.
